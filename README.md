# Deaths Caused by Terrorism
Terrorism is among the most widely discussed topics in current events today. Therefore, I decided to create a globe that shows deaths caused by terrorism since 1970. Given that the example in the challenge was written in JavaScript, I chose to use the same approach for writing the web application. In order to create an appropriate interactive graphic image, I first needed to write a short Java program to convert the data file found at the Global Terrorism Database. I had to represent the data in the expected format and the records had to be cumulative by latitude and longitude to minimize load time. I added a news feed in the application so that current world news was readily available as supplemental information. I enabled this using Google’s Dynamic Feed Control. Then I created an interface that allows the user to select, through a drop-down menu, any one of five videos relating to infamous attacks. Finally, I edited the Globe structure to automatically turn to a specified location. When a user selects a video, I utilized this edit to rotate the globe to the precise location of the event. My goal was to create a globe that provides an interesting visual that illustrates the severity of terrorism in a wide variety of locations around the world. I also wanted to provide an appropriate user interface to allow further exploration of infamous attacks, as well as to stay abreast of current news related to terrorism.
